       // now just keep placing numbers from 1 to n-1 . As the mumbers will always be smaller that indexes , so 
       // the indexes will never be able to divide the numbers completely . Just keep doing this with a leap of faith
       // and always believe in the code you wrute for it to work as you want . This in itself is a beautiful statement.
